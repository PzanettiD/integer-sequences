# Integer sequences from the "Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences" ([OEIS](https://oeis.org/))

This repository is where I'll the code that I made to generate some sequences in the OEIS, I'll try to do in multiple programming languages.

### Table of Contents
+ **[A000010](https://oeis.org/A000010)** Euler's totient function phi(n): counts numbers <= n and prime to n.
  - Currently available in Python / C

---

+ **[A000040](https://oeis.org/A000040)** The prime numbers.
  - Currently available in Python / C (using [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) algorithm).

---

+ **[A000045](https://oeis.org/A000045)** Fibonacci numbers: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
  - Currently available in Python / C (containing both a recursive and a bottom-up approach).
  
---

+ **[A000217](https://oeis.org/A000217)** Triangular numbers: a(n) = binomial(n+1,2) = n(n+1)/2 = 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + n.
  - Currently available in Python (containing both a arithmetic and a binomial method).
