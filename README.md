# Integer sequences from the "Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences" ([OEIS](https://oeis.org/))

This repository is where I'll the code that I made to generate some sequences in the OEIS, I'll try to do in multiple programming languages.

### Table of Contents
+ **[A000010](https://oeis.org/A000010)** Euler's totient function phi(n): counts numbers <= n and prime to n.
  - Currently available in Python / C

---

+ **[A000040](https://oeis.org/A000040)** The prime numbers.
  - Currently available in Python / C (using [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) algorithm).
